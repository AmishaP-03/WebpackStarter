# WebpackStarter
A starter project to see webpack in action

1. Create a new npm project

`npm init`
- Creates a project with only 1 file i.e package.json file.
- package.json files contains:
    a. Dependencies used in our project
    b. Scripts to build and execute our project

2. Create JS modules

- Create a `src` folder. This would segregate the core logic from other configuration/setup files.
- Create 2 JS files in that `src` folder.

3. Install and configure webpack
4. Run webpack
